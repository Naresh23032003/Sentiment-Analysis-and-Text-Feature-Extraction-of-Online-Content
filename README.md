# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Text-Feature-Extraction-of-Online-Content

Abstract

The vast amount of online content presents challenges in understanding its emotional tone (sentiment) and level of complexity (readability). This can hinder effective communication, information processing, and decision-making for users.
This project aims to develop a system for analyzing online content based on sentiment and text features, including readability metrics, complexity measures, and language usage patterns. By providing insights into the tone and complexity of online texts, this system can help users make informed decisions, improve content creation, and facilitate effective communication.
